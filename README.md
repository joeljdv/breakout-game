# Project-Q

This is a repository for breakout game made using JavaScript. This consist of 8 rows and 3 columns of bricks, a paddle, and a ball. Everytime the ball collides with a brick that brick dissapears and the score increments by 1, if the player breaks all the bricks and reaches 24 points, the player has won the game. At the start of the game, the player has 5 lives and loses 1 every time the ball touches the bottom of the grid, after losing all 5 lives the game is over. The game has a'start' button on top of the grid to start moving the ball or pause it. Once the player has won or lost the game a restart button appears which resets the game to its initial state.
